This is bob's text file that will be split depending on how many times a user wishes.
It will hopefully take that number that they choose and split this file into that many
subsiquent files. So if a user chooses they want to make six files, it will take this one
file and chop it into six equal parts. We will see if that works but for now let's hope
for the best.
